Installation

The script tested with OBS Studio versions 27.x and using python 3.6. 

You need Python 3 installed on your PC. The bit version of your Python installation

In the menu in OBS Studio, go to Tools and then Scripts. Then in the "Python Settings" tab, set the path to point to the Python installation folder.

Add the obs script to the "Scripts" window using the '+' icon on the bottom left. 
Select the script in the "Loaded Scripts" panel.
